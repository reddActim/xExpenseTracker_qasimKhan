this is a web application which can be used for tracking expenses.

the bar graph will be shown once expense is submitted

default balance is given as 5000 which can be incremented via "add income" button 

dont add negative amount on add income as i have not included that case in my code, (since build it as a project and for fun and learning purpose)

if you want to use to for your day to day life then one thing to keep in mind is that i have not added a database to it. The data is stored in the browser memory so if you clear browser memory then you data will be lost.

my main concern for building this project was to focus more on implementations and not on making it full proof.
